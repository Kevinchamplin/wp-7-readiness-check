## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in Champlin Pre-Flight Audit, please report it privately so we can fix it before public disclosure.

**Email:** hello@kevinchamplin.com (please put `[champlin-pre-flight-audit security]` in the subject line)

We will acknowledge receipt within 2 business days and aim to release a patch within 14 days for confirmed issues. Critical vulnerabilities (data exposure, privilege escalation, RCE) will be prioritized for same-day patches.

Please **do not** open a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities until a fix has been published.

## What's in scope

- The plugin's PHP code in `champlin-pre-flight-audit.php`, `includes/`, and `assets/`
- The AJAX endpoints registered by the plugin
- The snapshot system at `wp-content/wp7rc-snapshots/`
