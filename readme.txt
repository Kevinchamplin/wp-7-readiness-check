Premium pre-flight (and post-flight) audit for the WordPress 7.0 upgrade. 30+ automated checks. Visual readiness score. Free.

== Description ==

The WordPress 7.0 upgrade is the biggest core release in years — bringing the WP AI Client, DataViews, Block API v3, and a higher PHP floor. **This plugin runs a 30+ point automated audit** of your site against the WordPress 7.0 readiness criteria, with a visual score and remediation hints for every finding.

The same checks the engineering team at [Champlin Enterprises](https://champlinenterprises.com) runs across enterprise WordPress migrations, packaged free for the community.

= What it checks =

* **Server & runtime** — PHP version, OPcache, memory limit, max_execution_time, required extensions
* **Database** — MySQL/MariaDB version, InnoDB availability
* **WordPress core** — version, debug mode, auto-update status, HTTPS
* **Plugins** — pending updates, per-plugin compatibility headers, known-risky page-builder slugs
* **Themes** — active theme version, compatibility header, block vs classic, deprecated theme support
* **Custom code** — static scan of your theme + custom plugins for WordPress 7.0 breaking patterns (WP_List_Table, manage_posts_columns, Block API v2, Interactivity effect(), deprecated HTML5 script support, and more)
* **Headless & API** — WPGraphQL detection, custom REST routes
* **Multisite** — site count, super admins, 7.0 spam-flag behavior change
* **Security** — admin user count, 2FA plugin, backup plugin, file-edit lockdown, AI Connectors policy reminder

= What it does NOT do =

* It does not modify your site. Read-only.
* It does not phone home or transmit any data externally.
* It does not require a license key or account signup.

= Why it's free =

This plugin is the automated companion to the 80-point printable enterprise readiness checklist published by Champlin Enterprises at [champlinenterprises.com/wordpress-7-0-readiness-checklist.html](https://champlinenterprises.com/wordpress-7-0-readiness-checklist.html). Together they cover the engineering work of a WordPress 7.0 migration. If you'd rather have an engineer run it as an engagement, the contact link is in the dashboard footer.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin folder to `/wp-content/plugins/`, OR install via the Plugins admin page.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3. Navigate to **Tools → WP 7 Readiness** to run the audit.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does this work before AND after WordPress 7.0 is installed? =

Yes. On pre-7.0 sites it operates as a pre-flight audit. On post-7.0 sites it operates as a post-flight verification — checking that the upgrade landed cleanly.

= Will it modify my site? =

No. The plugin is strictly read-only. It scans your configuration and files; it does not write any changes.

= How long does the audit take? =

Typically under 5 seconds on most sites. The custom-code static scan is capped at 1500 files to ensure even very large sites complete quickly.

= Does it cover everything in the 80-point manual checklist? =

It covers the 30+ items that can be automated. The remaining 50 are human-judgment items — has the rollback been tested? has the AI Connectors policy been signed off? has the on-call rota been confirmed? — that no plugin can verify. The dashboard links to the printable checklist for the full audit.

== Screenshots ==

1. The readiness dashboard with visual score, summary pills, and category breakdown.
2. Per-finding view with status icon, technical detail, and remediation hint.

== Changelog ==

= 1.0.0 =
* Initial release.
* 30+ automated checks across 9 categories (server, database, WP core, plugins, themes, custom code, headless, multisite, security).
* Premium visual dashboard with animated readiness-score donut and color-coded findings.
* Print-friendly stylesheet — browser print dialog produces a clean PDF report.
* **Autofix support for 4 common issues** — each fix is one click, idempotent, and reversible:
  - Disable major auto-updates during the WordPress 7.0 launch window
  - Lock down in-admin file editing (drops a mu-plugin defining DISALLOW_FILE_EDIT)
  - Update all plugins to their latest stable releases (uses WordPress core's own Plugin_Upgrader)
  - Install and activate the official Two-Factor plugin from WordPress.org

== Upgrade Notice ==

= 1.0.0 =
Initial release.
