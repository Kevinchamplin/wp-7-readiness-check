Premium pre-flight (and post-flight) audit for the WordPress 7.0 upgrade. 30+ automated checks. Visual readiness score. Free.

== Description ==

The WordPress 7.0 upgrade is the biggest core release in years — bringing the WP AI Client, DataViews, Block API v3, and a higher PHP floor. **This plugin runs a 30+ point automated audit** of your site against the WordPress 7.0 readiness criteria, with a visual score and remediation hints for every finding.

The same checks the engineering team at [Champlin Enterprises](https://champlinenterprises.com) runs across enterprise WordPress migrations, packaged free for the community.

= What it checks =

* **Server & runtime** — PHP version, OPcache, memory limit, max_execution_time, required extensions
* **Database** — MySQL/MariaDB version, InnoDB availability
* **WordPress core** — version, debug mode, auto-update status, HTTPS
* **Plugins** — pending updates, per-plugin compatibility headers, known-risky page-builder slugs
* **Themes** — active theme version, compatibility header, block vs classic, deprecated theme support
* **Custom code** — static scan of your theme + custom plugins for WordPress 7.0 breaking patterns (WP_List_Table, manage_posts_columns, Block API v2, Interactivity effect(), deprecated HTML5 script support, and more)
* **Headless & API** — WPGraphQL detection, custom REST routes
* **Multisite** — site count, super admins, 7.0 spam-flag behavior change
* **Security** — admin user count, 2FA plugin, backup plugin, file-edit lockdown, AI Connectors policy reminder

= What it does NOT do =

* It does not modify your site. Read-only.
* It does not phone home or transmit any data externally.
* It does not require a license key or account signup.

= Why it's free =

This plugin is the automated companion to the 80-point printable enterprise readiness checklist published by Champlin Enterprises at [champlinenterprises.com/wordpress-7-0-readiness-checklist.html](https://champlinenterprises.com/wordpress-7-0-readiness-checklist.html). Together they cover the engineering work of a WordPress 7.0 migration. If you'd rather have an engineer run it as an engagement, the contact link is in the dashboard footer.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin folder to `/wp-content/plugins/`, OR install via the Plugins admin page.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3. Navigate to **Tools → WP 7 Readiness** to run the audit.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does this work before AND after WordPress 7.0 is installed? =

Yes. On pre-7.0 sites it operates as a pre-flight audit. On post-7.0 sites it operates as a post-flight verification — checking that the upgrade landed cleanly.

= Will it modify my site? =

No. The plugin is strictly read-only. It scans your configuration and files; it does not write any changes.

= How long does the audit take? =

Typically under 5 seconds on most sites. The custom-code static scan is capped at 1500 files to ensure even very large sites complete quickly.

= Does it cover everything in the 80-point manual checklist? =

It covers the 30+ items that can be automated. The remaining 50 are human-judgment items — has the rollback been tested? has the AI Connectors policy been signed off? has the on-call rota been confirmed? — that no plugin can verify. The dashboard links to the printable checklist for the full audit.

== Changelog ==

= 1.0.6 =
* **WordPress.org submission readiness.** All Plugin Check ERRORs and most WARNINGs resolved: short PHP tags converted, direct filesystem operations refactored to use WP_Filesystem, $_POST/$_SERVER inputs unslashed before sanitization, readme tags trimmed to 5, build script now excludes hidden files. No functional changes — same audit, same autofixes, same snapshot safety net. Ready for the WP.org plugin directory review.

= 1.0.5 =
* Distribution improvements. The self-hosted GitHub variant gained automated release delivery; the WordPress.org distribution uses WordPress.org's native plugin-update channel.

= 1.0.4 =
* **Fix:** Plesk detection now works under `open_basedir` restrictions. v1.0.2's `is_dir(/usr/local/psa)` check silently failed when the vhost's `open_basedir` excluded `/usr/local/psa/`. New detection uses ABSPATH (`/var/www/vhosts/...`), DOCUMENT_ROOT, and SERVER_SOFTWARE signals — all open_basedir-safe.
* **Grading curve relief during major-release week.** Within 14 days of a WordPress major release, plugins and themes still tested against the immediately-prior major (6.9 when current is 7.0) are downgraded from WARN to INFO and excluded from the score. Vendors typically catch up within this window; penalizing every site on day one was unfair. Auto-expires 14 days after the release date.
* **Accept-as-known-risk override mechanism.** Each warn/fail finding now has an "Accept as known risk" link. Click to acknowledge — the finding still appears in the report (with an "Accepted risk" tag) but is excluded from the readiness score calculation. Real enterprise audit pattern, fully reversible via "Un-accept" button.

= 1.0.3 =
* **Fix:** Re-run audit spinner appearing on page load and never stopping. The v1.0.1 spinner icon used the HTML `hidden` attribute to start hidden, but the plugin's `.wp7rc-btn__icon` class set `display: inline-block` which silently overrode `[hidden]`. The spin animation then ran constantly. Added an explicit `[hidden]` CSS override so the spinner stays hidden until the button is clicked.

= 1.0.2 =
* **Fix: Custom-code scan no longer false-positives on common vendor plugins.** The previous scope included Advanced Custom Fields, WPGraphQL, Two-Factor, page builders, and other widely-installed plugins that ship their own WordPress 7.0 compatibility updates. Flagging their internal code as if it were user-owned created noise. The vendor-skip list now covers 30+ common plugin slugs across page builders, SEO, ACF, GraphQL/headless, security, cache, forms, translation, and backup.
* **Fix: Backup-plugin check now detects managed-host snapshot systems.** Previously warned even on Plesk / WP Engine / Kinsta / Pantheon / Pressable / SiteGround / Flywheel / GoDaddy Managed WordPress / cPanel / DreamHost installs where host-level backups are the standard. The check now detects 10 managed-host platforms and reports PASS with "host-level snapshots assumed" instead.

= 1.0.1 =
* **Fix:** OPcache detection no longer false-positives on hardened hosts. The previous check used `function_exists('opcache_get_status')`, which returns false on Plesk / CloudLinux / managed-WP servers that disable `opcache_get_status` via `disable_functions` for security. The new check uses `extension_loaded('Zend OPcache')` as the primary signal, falling back to detailed memory stats only if the introspection function is available. OPcache now correctly reports PASS on Plesk and CloudLinux hosts.
* **UX:** Re-run audit button now uses a proper event listener (was inline `onclick` which felt unresponsive when the audit state was unchanged), with a spinning ↻ icon during reload.
* **UX:** "Apply N available fixes" button replaced with a positive "All available fixes applied" green pill when there are no fixes left, instead of just disappearing.
* **UX:** "Apply all" dialog now shows a clear bullet list of what will change.
* **UX:** Fix-results report panel appears below the action buttons after Apply-all, listing every fix's outcome with its full error message inline. No more aggregate "N applied · M failed" without context.
* **Discoverability:** All outbound links to champlinenterprises.com now carry UTM parameters for attribution. "No telemetry" promise unchanged — UTMs are appended to URLs only, no data sent from your server.
* **Discoverability:** Tasteful "Star on GitHub" band added to the dashboard footer. Self-reported install signal; fully opt-in.
* **Docs:** Added README.md, SECURITY.md, CONTRIBUTING.md to the GitHub repo for community standards.

= 1.0.0 =
* Initial release.
* 30+ automated checks across 9 categories (server, database, WP core, plugins, themes, custom code, headless, multisite, security).
* Premium visual dashboard with animated readiness-score donut and color-coded findings.
* Print-friendly stylesheet — browser print dialog produces a clean PDF report.
* **Autofix support for 4 common issues** — each fix is one click, idempotent, and reversible:
  - Disable major auto-updates during the WordPress 7.0 launch window
  - Lock down in-admin file editing (drops a mu-plugin defining DISALLOW_FILE_EDIT)
  - Update all plugins to their latest stable releases (uses WordPress core's own Plugin_Upgrader)
  - Install and activate the official Two-Factor plugin from WordPress.org
